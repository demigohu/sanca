            Sanca is an on-chain ROSCA (Rotating Savings and Credit Association) built on Stellar. Each
            member deposits their full collateral in USDC upfront. Every period, one member is randomly selected to receive the period&apos;s pot while their
            collateral stays locked.

                Collateral is held by the pool smart contract and earns yield via DeFindex while the pool runs.

                Winners are selected using Drand-backed randomness, and the winner schedule is pre-shuffled once at
                pool start, making the draw order fair and predictable (each member wins exactly once).

            In the next steps you&apos;ll see how a Sanca pool works, what your responsibilities are as a member, how
            funds and yield are distributed, and finally you can either join an existing pool or create your own.
